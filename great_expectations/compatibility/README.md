# Compatibility

This folder is meant to keep logic for ensuring compatibility between different versions of libraries that we support. For example raising or suppressing warnings, calling specific methods or using combinations of parameters based on library version.

Please name files based on the library for which it helps provide compatibility, and add multiple names if the combination is what we are supporting with the logic in the file.
